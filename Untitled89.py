# 1. What does one mean by the term "machine learning"?
# 

# Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence where computers can learn and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. They use data and statistical techniques to improve their performance on specific tasks.

# 2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?
# 

# Image/Object Recognition
# Language Processing
# Fraud Detection
# Personalized Recommendations

# 3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?
# 

# A labeled training set is data with known input-output pairs. The model learns from this data to make predictions or assign labels to new data. It adjusts its parameters to minimize errors and generalize its learning. Accuracy depends on the quality of the labeled data.

# 4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?
# 

# Classification: Assigning labels or categories to data based on its features
# Regression: Predicting numerical values or quantities based on input features 

# 5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?
# 

# Clustering: Grouping similar data together based on patterns or similarities.
# 
# Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in data.
# 
# Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying data by reducing the number of features.
# 
# Association Rule Learning: Discovering relationships or associations among items in a dataset.

# 6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?
# 

# 
# To make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains, a reinforcement learning model is the best choice. It learns by taking actions and receiving rewards based on its performance, allowing it to navigate and adapt to different terrains over time.

# 7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?
# 

# To divide customers into different groups, the k-means clustering algorithm is commonly used. It groups customers based on their similarities, allowing businesses to better understand and cater to different customer segments.

# 8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?
# 

# Spam detection is a supervised learning problem.

# 9.What is the concept of an online learning system?
# 

# An online learning system continuously updates and improves its predictions as new data arrives, making it adaptable to changing patterns and suitable for real-time decision-making.

# 10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?
# 

# out-of-core learning is used when the dataset is too large to fit into memory, and it processes the data in manageable chunks from disk, while in-core learning operates directly on the entire dataset loaded into memory.

# 11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?
# 

# algorithms like k-nearest neighbors, case-based reasoning, and memory-based reasoning make predictions by comparing the similarity between the new instance and the training instances, using a similarity measure as the basis for their decision-making.

# 12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?
# 

# model parameters are learned from the training data and directly influence the model's predictions, while hyperparameters are external settings that control the behavior and performance of the learning algorithm.

# 13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?
# 

# Model-based learning algorithms aim for accuracy, generalization, and simplicity. They use optimization techniques to find optimal model parameters and make predictions based on the learned model using mathematical equations, rules, or functions specific to each model.

# 14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?
# 

# Overfitting and underfitting
# Data quality and quantity
# Feature engineering and selection
# Computational complexity and scalability

# 15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?
# 

# If the model overfits and fails to generalize, options to address this include regularization techniques, cross-validation for performance evaluation, and increasing the size of the training data.

# 16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?
# 

# A test set is a dataset used to evaluate how well a trained model performs on unseen data. It helps determine if the model is good enough to be used in real-world situations. Having a test set separate from the training data ensures unbiased evaluation and prevents overfitting.

# 17.What is a validation set's purpose?
# 

# A validation set is used to fine-tune a machine learning model during training. It helps choose the best model and settings, preventing overfitting. It provides an unbiased evaluation, but a separate test set is used for final performance assessment.

# 18.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?
# 

# Risk of overfitting to the test set.
# Biased and overly optimistic results.
# Lack of independent evaluation for generalization assessment.
